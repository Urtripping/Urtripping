The first presentation is Portfolio 1. [Uploading Portfolio_1_47651989.ipynb…]()
-- This portfolio was about the basics of Jupyter Notebook.
-- We learned how to read a dataset and how to present it in a table form.
-- Deleting, adding and making chnages to tables was taught in this Portfolio.
-- My favourite part was comparing the items and printing out the bar graphs to help in the analysis.

The second presentation is Portfolio 2. [Uploading Portfolio_2_questions.ipynb…]()
-- The second portfolio was an upgraded version of the first part using the same dataset with the updated form of the dataset.
-- We did more of training and testing of the dataset here to help in the better analysis of the data.
-- Lastly, we evaluated the models, visualised, compared and analyzed the data.

The third Presentation is Portfolio 3. [Uploading Portfolio_3_questions.ipynb…]()
-- In portfolio 3 we were given a new dataset with its own set of problems
-- This portfolio was a bit different from the rest since we had to solve the problems in a similar manner from what we had to perform before.
-- we also had to make our own comments and description for the data as we were already familiar with the pattern.
